## 🌟 Why This Matters

> "In a world of constant data breaches, what if servers literally couldn't read your data?"

This project demonstrates a fundamental shift in authentication architecture:

- 🔒 **True Privacy**: Servers store encrypted data they cannot decrypt
- 🗝️ **User Sovereignty**: Only you hold the decryption keys
- 🛡️ **Breach-Proof**: Even if our database is stolen, your data stays safe
- ⚡ **Modern Crypto**: PGP, AES-256-GCM, PBKDF2, and bcrypt

## 🚀 The Future of Authentication

Traditional auth: "Trust us with your data"
Zero-knowledge: "We can't even access your data"

This isn't just another login system - it's a blueprint for privacy-first applications.
